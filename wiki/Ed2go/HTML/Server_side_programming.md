# Server-side Programming
Server-side programming involves writing code that connects web pages with databases, XML pages, email servers, file systems, and other systems and software accessible from the web server. The most common server-side languages and programming frameworks are PHP, Java Enterprise Edition, ASP.NET, ColdFusion, Node.js, and Python.

# PHP
PHP (https://www.php.net) is open source. It is the language behind WordPress and has long been a popular alternative to proprietary languages such as ColdFusion and ASP.NET. PHP is lightweight and relatively simple to learn.

# Java EE
Java EE (https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/index.html) is used in large web projects. With its power and robustness comes a steep learning curve.

# ASP.NET
Microsoftâ€™s ASP.NET (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) is not a language, but a framework for writing websites and software. ASP.NET pages can be written in many languages, but the most popular are C# (pronounced C-sharp) and Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET).

# ColdFusion
ColdFusion (https://coldfusion.adobe.com), created by Allaire (now owned by Adobe), is arguably the simplest of all server-side languages. It is tag-based, which makes it look a lot like HTML and easier for client-side programmers to understand than some of the other choices.

# Node.js
Node.js (https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime that can run on the server, allowing developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting as well as client-side scripting.

# Python
Python (https://www.python.org) has been a popular open-source programming language for a long time. There are many web frameworks based on Python, the most popular of which is Django (https://www.djangoproject.com).
