# Client-side Programming
Client-side programming involves writing code that is interpreted by a browser, such as Google Chrome or Safari, whether it be on your desktop or mobile device. The most common languages and technologies used in client-side programming are HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript.

# HTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the language behind most web pages. The language is made up of elements that describe the structure of the content on a web page.

# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used in HTML pages to format and lay out the content. CSS rules defining color, size, positioning, and other display aspects of elements are mixed within the HTML code or in linked external style sheets.

# JavaScript
JavaScript is used to make HTML pages more dynamic and interactive. It can be used to validate forms, pop up new windows, create audio and video controls, and create dynamic effects such as drop-down menus and modal dialogs.

# Ajax
The term Ajax was originally a pseudo-acronym for “Asynchronous JavaScript and XML,” but is now used much more broadly to cover all methods of communicating with a server using JavaScript.

The main purpose of Ajax is to provide a simple and standard means for a web page to communicate with the server without a complete page refresh.

# JavaScript Frameworks
JavaScript frameworks are frameworks written in JavaScript that create a different approach to web application design. Popular frameworks include Angular (https://angular.io), React (https://react.dev/), Vue.js (https://vuejs.org), and jQuery (https://jquery.com). You should learn JavaScript before beginning to work with a JavaScript framework.

# CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks are frameworks that allow you to quickly design HTML pages with a predefined set of CSS classes. The most popular CSS framework is Bootstrap, which comes with a library of stylish components that you can easily incorporate into your website. Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that allows for more customization, but requires a better understanding of CSS.
