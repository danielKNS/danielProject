# Data Types :

* Strings = "hello world"
* Numbers = 1 2 3 4 5 ..
* Arrays/list = [1,2,3,4,5] or ["hello world"]
* Boonleans = true or false

// GO SEE EXAPLES IN (dataTypes.js)
# Operatos :
* (+) = add
* (-) = take aways
* (*) = times
* / = divide
* % = division remainder (modulus)
* ++ = increase
* -- = decrease
* && = and 
* || = or
* ; is needed on the end  of every statement
* {} = start and where it finish a  funtion
* [] = an array
etc

# Statements :
* const = declares a variable with a constant value 
* let = declares a variable
* var = declares a variable
* funtion = declares a function
* break = exit a switch or a loop
* for = loop through block of code a number of times
* if = is used when a statement or an codition is true
* else = is used when the same statement/codition is false
* else if = is used when the first statement/codition false
* switch = is when to specify many alternative block of code to be executed

# Arrow function :
* Arrow function allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular funtions.
* Arrow funtions are best used for callbacks, methods like map, reduce and forEach .
